Create a dataset by parsing the webpage.  This is the base URL (https://admn5015-340805.uc.r.appspot.com/2018-01-01.html).  
Download these fields (date, price, likes, dislikes, and followers) for each day by changing the URL accordingly, starting on January 1st, 2018 until December 31st, 2023.
Predict the price of the website's product (you would be predicting the price for January 1st, 2024).

The correlation matrix indicates the correlation coefficients between different pairs of variables in this DataFrame.
Price and Likes:
The correlation coefficient between Price and Likes is 0.8262. This suggests a strong positive correlation, indicating that as the number of Likes increases, the Price tends to increase as well.
Price and Dislikes:
The correlation coefficient between Price and Dislikes is 0.8238. Similar to Likes, there is a strong positive correlation, suggesting that as the number of Dislikes increases, the Price tends to increase.
Price and Followers:
The correlation coefficient between Price and Followers is 0.8255. Again, there is a strong positive correlation, indicating that as the number of Followers increases, the Price tends to increase.
Likes and Dislikes:
The correlation coefficient between Likes and Dislikes is 0.9995. This extremely high correlation suggests that Likes and Dislikes are almost perfectly correlated, which might indicate redundancy in your features.
Likes and Followers:
The correlation coefficient between Likes and Followers is 0.99999. Similar to Likes and Dislikes, there's an extremely high positive correlation, indicating that Likes and Followers are almost perfectly correlated.
Dislikes and Followers:
The correlation coefficient between Dislikes and Followers is 0.9995. Like Likes and Followers, there's an extremely high positive correlation between Dislikes and Followers.

The predicted price for January 1st, 2024, is: 445592.5878000006
The model demonstrates the following:
Baseline Model Evaluation:
The mean retail price in the training dataset is approximately 120,373.82.𝑇ℎ𝑒𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙,𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠,ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑎𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝐴𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑒𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟(𝑀𝐴𝐸)𝑜𝑓𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑦 140,044.50.
Prediction for January 1st, 2024:
I found the most recent data point before January 1st, 2024, since there is no data available for that date. Extracted the feature values (Likes, Dislikes, Followers) from the most recent data point. 
Created a DataFrame with these feature values for January 1st, 2024. Used my trained RandomForestRegressor model to predict the price for January 1st, 2024. The predicted price for January 1st, 2024, is approximately $445,592.59.
These results suggest that my trained model, based on historical data, predicts a significantly different price for January 1st, 2024, compared to the baseline model. 
The model takes into account the patterns in the data and provides a more refined prediction for the given feature values.
